abstract = "Using a projected integral expansion technique, the energy of a molecule calculated at the SCF level is expressed approximately but to a good accuracy as a sum of atomic and diatomic contributions, the computation of which requires the use of one- and two-center integrals only. The decomposition is exact for diatomic molecules, while the three- and four-center effects are compressed into one- and two-center ones as much as it is possible by performing appropriate projections. The proposed scheme is devised to perform a posteriori analysis of the wave functions obtained in the actual SCF calculations: the energy components obtained permit one to identify the different chemically relevant interactions in a molecule and give a useful tool for interpretations and perhaps predictions."

	abstract = {Abstract The physical and chemical meaning of real space molecular fragments resulting from arbitrary partitions of the density is reviewed under a common unifying formalism. Both fuzzy (interpenetrating) and non-fuzzy (exhaustive) decompositions are treated on an equal basis. Density decompositions are consistently generalized to compatible density matrix partitions by using Li and Parr's ideas (Li and Parr J Chem Phys 1986, 84, 1704), and these are carried onto an energy partition. It is argued that the merits of a given decomposition should be judged against both the charge and the energetic image it provides. Atomic partitions are used to show how the interacting quantum atoms approach (IQA) allows us to cope with the most important energy cancellations of quantum chemistry. Binding results from a trade-off between atomic (or fragment) energy deformations with respect to a reference and interatomic (interfragment) interactions. Deformation energies are divided into charge transfer and redistribution terms and their relative roles are analyzed. A number of systems are compared against the fuzziness of different density decompositions. The results consistently show that fuzzy partitions tend to give low atomic net charges and enhanced covalency, while exhaustive partitions generate larger net charges and smaller covalencies, across a wide range of bonding regimes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
